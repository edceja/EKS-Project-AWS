# EKS-Project-AWS
Repository for all AWS EKS project code 

Phase 4 capstone project posed by the folks at [Learn to Cloud](https://learntocloud.guide/).

## Architecture 

An AWS EKS cluster with 2 nodes. The front end deployment consists of a containerized Node.js application, a corresponding service and an ingress resource. Similarly, the backend
is a containerized FastAPI Python application running a Uvicorn server. The backend also has a corresponding service and ingress resource.
